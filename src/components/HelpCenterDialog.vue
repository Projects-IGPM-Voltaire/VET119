            MediQueue is a queueing management system that allows patients to
            book an appointment online beforehand without visiting the actual
            health center. The available schedules provided in the website will
            be the appointment time of the patient based on the services they
            needed. This allows them to choose the most suitable schedule that
            works for them and decrease their waiting time.
